When the compartmental model or the model options change, should input widget
values be updated with the defaults?

When frozen, your variable and parameter input values are not overridden when
the model or a model option changes. Freezing is useful to enable comparing
different compartmental models or the same compartmental model with different
model options (with or without vital dynamics, or pseudo- or true-mass action).

When the checkbox is not marked/selected/checked the input values are "thawed"
(or updating input values is unfrozen), and all widgets will have an
**appropriate** value when you select a different model type or enable or
disable a model option.
